Verification state at 2026-07-14: e2e 47/47, unit 203/203, db 13/13, lint/typecheck green; run e2e via `bash scripts/test-e2e-local.sh`
The former NEXT status above was superseded by the owner-approved specification-alignment design and plan.

## Phase 0 specification alignment

Phase 0 specification alignment: COMPLETE

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-colorplay-specification-alignment.md`
Plan commit: `a0c0ca7`
Task 1: complete (`dd6e1b9`; reproducible document-manifest generator and contract tests)
Task 2: complete (`7e98a2f`; legacy migration decisions and sanitized inventory)
Task 3: complete (`f05c95b`; Local, Staging, Production, and Vercel environment contract)
Task 4: complete (`07abf6d`; routes, feature boundaries, and browser/server trust boundaries)
Task 5: complete (`7b10113`; learning, progress, rewards, assignment, and Live contracts)
Task 6: complete (`7302d78`; governance and Phase 0–8 delivery roadmap)
Task 7: complete (`34467ad`; 38 new criteria, 122 total acceptance IDs, and manifest reconciliation)
Task 8: complete in the closure commit containing this progress record; no product phase is marked complete by this entry.

Closure verification on 2026-07-16: Phase 0 changed-file Prettier check passed against `030a44a`; lint and typecheck passed; Vitest passed 35 files and 207 tests; acceptance metadata reported 122 IDs; document-manifest check, unresolved-marker scan, superseded-plan checks, and `git diff --check` passed. No acceptance suite, database tests, E2E tests, browser evidence, hosted-resource changes, or remote deployment actions were run in Phase 0.

### Existing repository formatting debt

Repository-wide `pnpm format:check` was already red at baseline `030a44a` for these eight Phase 0-unchanged files:

- `docs/content/import-review.md`
- `docs/content/README.md`
- `scripts/content/import-questions.mjs`
- `tests/e2e/login.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/quiz-runner.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/session-lifecycle.spec.ts`
- `tests/fixtures/content-manifest.generated.ts`
- `tests/fixtures/question-answers.generated.ts`

`git diff --stat 030a44a -- <the eight paths above>` produced no output and exited 0, confirming that Phase 0 did not change them. The `Check formatting` step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` therefore fails globally in the existing state; Phase 0 did not introduce that failure.

The two `tests/fixtures/*.generated.ts` files are generated by `scripts/content/import-questions.mjs`. Formatting only their checked-in copies will regress on the next `content:import`; the durable correction is to pass generated output through Prettier in the generator. That is M-level Phase 1 prerequisite work and is outside Phase 0. The owner separately authorized an S-level, post-review formatting-only maintenance commit for the eight files; it is excluded from the Phase 0 review range.

Phase 0 review: pending one complete-range review after the closure commit.
Status: STOP after the authorized review and formatting-only maintenance commit; do not begin Game Economy v2 without a new project-owner instruction.

## Phase 1 Game Economy v2

Phase 1 Game Economy v2: COMPLETE

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-game-economy-v2.md`
Plan commit: `a6770d1`
Task 1: complete (`56bb3a3`; content import formats generated fixtures through Prettier)
Task 2: complete (`0a361f7`; immutable XP and Token ledgers, wallet cache, and reconciliation)
Task 3: complete (`38d7204`; authoritative quiz-finalize reward transaction)
Task 4: complete (`60378d5`; daily reward decay and level rules)
Task 5: complete (`26317d4`; student economy summary repository and integration)
Task 6: complete (`a1b5547`; six starter Blooks, inventory, purchase, and equip boundaries)
Task 7: complete (`346768f`; student economy and result UI)
Task 8: complete (`6ae6409`; Blook shop and inventory UI)
Task 9: complete (`efb7087`; Game Economy phase gate and evidence finalizer)

Complete-range review: completed against baseline `a6770d1`; findings were corrected in `c51553a`. Database test isolation was hardened in `18cb23c`, and parallel Auth integration sessions were isolated in `0fb723e`.

Four formal gate failures were resolved before the successful fifth run:

1. The first run used global pgTAP row counts that included seeded Auth fixtures. Commit `18cb23c` scoped assertions to test-owned UUIDs without weakening expected behavior.
2. The second run exposed parallel integration tests calling global sign-out against shared users. Commit `0fb723e` added dedicated Auth lifecycle fixtures and local-only cleanup where sign-out itself was not the behavior under test.
3. The third run exposed a foundation aggregate-view inconsistency: the original `submit_quiz_answer` never updated stored session aggregates, so the in-progress view returned zero after valid answers. Commit `c3ebd8d` added the authoritative live aggregate view while preserving finalize-time stored values; `35e01e8` kept pre-checks outside the evidence pipeline, and `2cd9c37`/`d74eb43` corrected strict E2E locator ambiguity found during pre-check.
4. The fourth run applied text regexes directly to compressed WebM bytes and reported an eight-character binary false positive that did not match a test identity. Commit `abd2e7a` validates PNG/WebM magic bytes, scans container metadata rather than compressed payload bytes, and preserves all sensitive-string checks for text evidence and textual trace entries.

Phase gate PASS on 2026-07-16 at clean SHA `abd2e7aab022b74879ffe868656c137030df20d0`: Prettier, lint, typecheck, 43 Vitest files/286 tests, production build, 184 pgTAP assertions, 7 integration files/18 tests, and the headed Chromium Game Economy flow all passed. The known 667.69 kB main-chunk warning remains non-blocking and is assigned to later route-level code splitting.

Manifest: `artifacts/acceptance/game-economy-v2-abd2e7aab022b74879ffe868656c137030df20d0/manifest.json` (`decision: PASS`; `AC-GAME-001`–`AC-GAME-007`, `AC-SEC-001`, and `AC-SEC-002`).

Status: STOP after Phase 1 closure; do not begin Phase 2 without a new project-owner instruction.

## Phase 2 Achievements

Phase 2 Achievements: COMPLETE

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-achievements.md`
Plan commit: `bf7b0df`
Task 1: complete (`acfaa64`; versioned achievement catalog, nine badge-only definitions, RLS, and four truthful catalog-only entries)
Task 2: complete (`c59d2bb`; trusted server-side achievement progress derivation)
Task 3: complete (`ffc8499`; transactional, replay-safe unlocks from quiz finalize and economy events)
Task 4: complete (`201db00`; privacy-safe achievement catalog repository and real-local integration)
Task 5: complete (`8000e8f`; TanStack Query achievement catalog boundary)
Task 6: complete (`bfd6b88`; student badge route and responsive UI)
Task 7: complete (`0b64055`; shared evidence policy and Achievements phase gate)

Complete-range review covered `c81d870..0b64055`. Important findings were corrected in `f72a670`: PostgreSQL UTC `+00:00` timestamps are accepted without accepting non-UTC offsets; evidence paths are containment-checked before reads; required binary evidence enforces its expected extension; and the generic E2E command excludes the acceptance-only Achievements gate. The reviewed clean SHA was `f72a67004f0597eb7d90fcb4f2c1c85fd3f14bf0`.

The first formal gate reached the headed Achievements flow but exposed an E2E synchronization race: the test could read the previous prompt immediately after clicking `我理解了，下一題`. Owner-approved S-level commit `f53b67c` waits for `第 N / 10 題` before reading each prompt. Its focused verification passed 49 contract assertions and one headless acceptance-mode Chromium run using disposable evidence outside `artifacts/acceptance/`; the failed `achievements-f72a6700*` evidence was deleted.

The second formal gate passed on 2026-07-17 at clean SHA `f53b67c11a7d444d4f12b97f85eeed6d87c31373`: Prettier, lint, typecheck, 49 Vitest files/345 tests, production build, 11 database files/300 pgTAP assertions, the isolated runtime smoke 3/3, 8 integration files/19 tests, Auth seed, and the headed Chromium Achievements flow all passed. The known 667.90 kB main-chunk warning remains non-blocking and is assigned to later route-level code splitting.

Manifest: `artifacts/acceptance/achievements-f53b67c11a7d444d4f12b97f85eeed6d87c31373/manifest.json` (`decision: PASS`; `AC-ACH-001`–`AC-ACH-005`).

The four catalog-only dependencies remain truthful `not_started` entries until their owning phases exist:

- `mistakes_resolved_10` depends on the future remediation and mistake-resolution phase.
- `chapter_mastered_1` depends on the future mastery phase.
- `all_chapters_mastered` depends on the future mastery phase.
- `live_complete_5` depends on the future Live phase.

Forward note: `completed_task_count` and `correct_streak` currently derive from all completed quiz sessions. When later phases add assignment/remediation session purposes and Live answers, those derivations must be revisited with a `rule_version` bump so remediation attempts never count.

Status: STOP after Phase 2 closure; do not begin Classroom/Leaderboard, Assignments, Live, remediation, mastery, or any other phase without a new project-owner instruction.

## Phase 3 Classroom and Leaderboard v2

Phase 3 Classroom and Leaderboard v2: COMPLETE

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-classroom-leaderboard-v2.md`
Plan commit: `039a012`
Task 1: complete (`0964058`; isolated classroom tables, column privacy, tenant RLS)
Task 2: complete (`3bcd35c`; trusted create/rotate/join commands and safe projections)
Task 3: complete (`e16f9c1`; authoritative Top 10 plus self leaderboard RPC)
Task 4: complete (`83c1371`; deterministic classroom fixtures and generated types)
Task 5: complete (`afeee04`; classroom repository and query/mutation hooks)
Task 6: complete (`577554f`; privacy-safe leaderboard repository and hook)
Task 7: complete (`3d42f9f`; student join routes with preserved join intent)
Task 8: complete (`5d822e6`; teacher classroom management under `/teacher/classes`)
Task 9: complete (`cf8a25b`; classroom leaderboard page at `/app/leaderboard/:classroomId`)
Task 10: complete (`4881f69`; Phase 3 runner, finalizer, and acceptance E2E)

Complete-range review covered `65d8b70..4881f69`. Two Important findings were corrected in `cb90250`: manual Playwright contexts received an explicit `baseURL`, and the teacher view verifies a single membership row after repeated joins.

Gate history (each failure produced one focused, owner-authorized fix; no assertion was weakened):

- Precheck 1 failed: URL parsed before teacher navigation completed; `ebe21d9` waits for the `/teacher/classes/<UUID>` route.
- Precheck 2 failed: browser health treated the intentional stale-join-code 400 and navigation-cancelled background queries as defects; `24549ca` adds declared expected browser failures (enumerated 4xx only, each must be observed exactly) and settles queries before navigation.
- Precheck 3 failed: the owner's one-declaration constraint conflicted with required outsider/Teacher B denials; `4763cc9` enumerates all three denial declarations (`join_classroom` 400, `get_classroom_leaderboard` 403, `list_owned_classroom_members` 403).
- Formal gate 1 failed at Auth seed: PostgREST schema cache raced the post-reset seed (HTTP 503, ~9 s reconnect); `5ccc8ff` adds the shared bounded readiness probe `scripts/supabase/wait-for-postgrest.sh`, and every future runner must order reset → probe → seed.
- Formal gate 2 failed in the integration suite: economy and inventory integration tests shared `studentOne`, so a parallel real quiz plus Blook purchase (750 XP / 150 Token) raced the economy test's exact zero assertions; `ceb0f23` gives both files dedicated seed accounts (`economyStudentOne/Two`, `inventoryStudentOne/Two`), verified by two consecutive reset+seed+integration runs (23/23 both).
- Formal gate 3 failed headed-only: 6.2 s after the outsider's declared leaderboard 403, a window visibility change made TanStack Query refetch the errored query and emit a second undeclared 403 (trace network events confirm both came from the outsider page); `a5edd25` closes negative-path browser contexts immediately after their denial assertions while keeping their health recordings for the final strict checks.
- Formal gate 4 passed on 2026-07-17 at clean SHA `a5edd25e55db8300729385a16b911ebe0444c179`: Prettier, lint, typecheck, 63 Vitest files/427 tests, production build, 14 database files/398 pgTAP assertions plus runtime smoke 3/3, 11 integration files/23 tests, PostgREST readiness probe, Auth seed, and the headed Chromium classroom flow (teacher, two students, outsider, Teacher B) all passed with zero unexpected browser-health events and all three declared denials observed exactly once.

Manifest: `artifacts/acceptance/classroom-leaderboard-a5edd25e55db8300729385a16b911ebe0444c179/manifest.json` (`decision: PASS`; `AC-AUTH-005`–`AC-AUTH-007`, `AC-GAME-008`, `AC-GAME-009`).

Conventions added in this phase (binding on later phases):

- Runners order reset → `scripts/supabase/wait-for-postgrest.sh` → seed; never seed against an unprobed PostgREST.
- Any integration test that mutates or asserts exact economy state uses dedicated seed accounts; shared `studentOne/studentTwo` stay reserved for state-tolerant flows.
- Browser negative paths declare each expected 4xx (URL pattern, status, count); declarations must be observed exactly, 5xx is never declarable, and no status-level or global filter exists.
- Negative-path browser contexts close immediately after their denial assertions; idle errored windows refetch on headed visibility changes and emit undeclared denials.

Reservations recorded per the plan:

- Assignments and Live reference `classrooms.id` and call the active-membership predicate in their own phases.
- Leaderboard privacy modes require an additive trusted setting/projection and are not inferred from the browser.
- Analytics receives a separately authorized aggregate interface and never broadens the leaderboard response.
- If a later trusted leave lifecycle creates inactive earning intervals, leaderboard membership-window derivation must be versioned and expanded before such intervals are enabled.
- `AC-PERF-003` staging 30-sample p95, full `AC-UI-001/002`, real-device, and production evidence remain unverified until Phase 8.

The known ~668 kB main-chunk warning remains non-blocking and assigned to later route-level code splitting. Executor note: after Codex quota exhaustion, the owner instructed Claude Code to complete the phase tail (formal gates 2–4, their fixes, and this closure) under the same plan and constraints.

Status: Phase 3 closed; the owner then authorized Claude Code to continue planning and executing the remaining phases ("可以繼續往下規劃，完成這個專案"), with per-phase closure reports.

## Phase 4 Assignments and ColorPlay Live Core

Phase 4 Assignments and ColorPlay Live Core: COMPLETE

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-assignments-live-core.md`
Plan commit: `77242d1` (baseline `dc77049`)
Task 1: complete (`98ab11b`; pinned assignment reward rules and Live scoring `2026-07-live-1`)
Task 2: complete (`2e0ca1d`; assignment tables, targets, attempts, quiz-session purpose column)
Task 3: complete (`5aefeda`; trusted assignment lifecycle commands and finalize derivation)
Task 4: complete (`ca9dfa7`; assignment repository, hooks, and generated types)
Task 5: complete (`48b84f5`; teacher assignment management under the classroom detail)
Task 6: complete (`066c7dc`; student assignment list, detail, attempt flow, result banner)
Task 7: complete (`3f938aa`; live tables, enums, RLS, hidden-answer column privacy)
Task 8: complete (`4276c47`; live activity/session setup commands and question freezing)
Task 9: complete (`250f719`, expectation aligned in `fa9b02a`; live play commands and atomic finalize)
Task 10: complete (`00998fd`; private realtime topic, RLS on `realtime.messages`, in-transaction broadcasts)
Task 11: complete (`900b680`; live repository with pre-feedback reveal-leak rejection, session/commands hooks)
Task 12: complete (`30fcfc2`; join page, player session page, host console)
Task 13: complete (`4ecf41f`; Phase 4 runner, finalizer, contract pins, acceptance E2E)

Complete-range review covered `dc77049..4ecf41f` (three parallel finder angles plus direct verification; 24 candidates, 10 confirmed). All ten were corrected in `cdfb0e0`, including three gate-blocking defects (host answered-count never updated — submits now broadcast the count at the same state version and the session hook patches equal-version progress; the finalizer still carried the Phase 3 grep label; the round-3 reload pressured the 5 s speed-bonus window) and two security findings (participants could pre-read all frozen questions from the lobby — migration `20260717001100` gates participant selects on `opened_at`; a reused `client_request_id` could bind a foreign practice session to an assignment — migration `20260717001200` adds the fresh-session guard). Recorded, not fixed: replace-forward migration duplication (established pattern), a fourth finalizer copy (refactor deferred), per-participant finalize loops, declared-failure array-order coupling, completed-replay `participant_count` drift, and submit broadcasts being outside `019`'s counted window.

Gate history (each failure produced one focused fix; no assertion was weakened):

- Precheck 1 (the spec's first complete run) hung 480 s: the spec clicked a classroom link by the classroom's name, but the classes page names that link 管理班級; fixed in `8014d62`.
- Precheck 2 failed at student join: the spec skipped the host's 開啟等待室 step, so joins were correctly rejected with `LIVE_JOIN_INVALID_CODE` while the session was still `draft`; the spec now opens the lobby (`8014d62`).
- Precheck 3 failed at the host lobby count: joining never broadcast, so lobby views held a stale participant count until the first transition — a real product gap. Migration `20260717001300` broadcasts the active participant count at the unchanged `state_version`, the session hook patches equal-version progress counts in place, and `019` now counts the join broadcast (18 assertions) (`8014d62`).
- Precheck 4 failed the final health check: the post-login navigation aborted the in-flight chapter manifest fetch; sign-in now settles the chapter query before navigating away (`8014d62`).
- Precheck 5 exposed the worst defect: when the duplicate-tab probe clicked a stale 下一題, a landing broadcast had morphed the button in place, so the click fired the swapped 收題並公布答案 with a fresh version and closed round 7 with zero answers. The host action button is now keyed by transition (a stale click dies on the detached node), and the spec races both host tabs' advances concurrently — the compare-and-set admits exactly one, and the conflict alert must appear on exactly one tab, whichever loses (`8014d62`). Precheck 6 then passed headless.
- Formal gate 1 failed at `format:check`: one file drifted during the review wave; formatted in `1886804`.
- Formal gate 2 passed the headed E2E but failed evidence collection: the finalizer required exactly one video while the host context records two pages (console plus duplicate tab); `91e5c51` expects both.
- Formal gate 3 failed headed-only: background tabs stop painting, so the duplicate tab's click never satisfied the animation-frame stability wait and dispatched only after the winner's broadcast had detached the keyed button; both racing clicks now dispatch with `force: true`, validated by a headed disposable precheck before re-running the gate (`f16902b`).
- Formal gate 4 passed on 2026-07-18 at clean SHA `f16902b63b02a4bc29ae2e50584ea9d666a878ce`: Prettier, lint, typecheck, 71 Vitest files/470 tests, production build, 20 database files/610 pgTAP assertions plus runtime smoke 3/3, 13 integration files/25 tests, PostgREST readiness probe, Auth seed, and the headed Chromium flow (teacher assignment lifecycle, student assignment completion through the real quiz runner with reward banner, two 10-round live matches with two students, mid-question reload reconciliation, outsider denial, and the dual-host-tab version-conflict race) all passed. Live latency over 40 answer samples: answer p95 6 ms (≤ 800), finalize p95 11 ms (≤ 1000), zero lost or duplicate answers, zero outsider access; browser health recorded zero unexpected events with both declared 400s (`join_live_session`, `advance_live_session`) observed exactly once.

Manifest: `artifacts/acceptance/assignments-live-f16902b63b02a4bc29ae2e50584ea9d666a878ce/manifest.json` (`decision: PASS`; `AC-ASN-001`–`AC-ASN-006`, `AC-LIVE-001`–`AC-LIVE-012`).

Conventions added in this phase (binding on later phases):

- In-state live progress (answered counts, participant counts) broadcasts at the unchanged `state_version`; clients patch equal-version payloads in place and refetch only on newer versions.
- Trusted commands that admit or progress participants must broadcast anything a live view renders; a view with no broadcast source is a defect, not a polling candidate.
- Action buttons whose meaning changes with server state are keyed by that meaning so stale clicks die instead of retargeting.
- Concurrent-conflict E2E scenarios dispatch racing commands together (forced clicks, background-tab throttling in mind) and assert the outcome invariant (exactly one winner, conflict surfaced on the loser) rather than scripting who loses.

Reservations recorded per the plan:

- Phase 7 advanced Live scope (team modes, power-ups, media questions, pacing analytics) stays deferred.
- The `remediation` quiz-session purpose value is reserved and unused until the remediation phase.
- `AC-LIVE-012` latency figures are local-loop evidence; staging revalidation with real network latency is owed at Phase 8.
- The ~668 kB main-chunk warning remains non-blocking and assigned to later route-level code splitting.
- Live joins during `question_open`/`question_feedback` only re-admit existing participants; first-time admission after the lobby closes is a product decision deferred to Phase 7.
- Concurrent same-version join broadcasts can momentarily deliver a lower participant count; any transition heals it, and lobby-only exposure keeps the risk cosmetic.

Status: Phase 4 closed. Next per the roadmap: Phase 5 (復習卡/學習內容; needs 複習卡內容 from the owner), then staging setup (owner supplies Supabase access token, legacy-project reset authorization, GitHub repo, Vercel).
